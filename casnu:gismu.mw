[[User:Bobas|Bobas]], why did you change the link to English version of this article? [[en:Gismu]] was a separate article dedicated to Lojban gismu. [[User:Inego|Inego]] 06:36, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

:'gismu' means 'root word', correct? i wasn't aware that it only refered to lojban root words. mi'e [[user:Bobas|bobas]] 21:30, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

::It is kind of an awkward situation. The English Wikipedia article "Gismu" seems to be about Lojban root words. Jbovlaste says, lo gismu "is a (Lojban) root word expressing relation ..." So, it's not totally clear if this article should be specifically about lojbanic gismu. However, the English article on "Root (linguistics)" isn't exactly the same concept, either. I'd be inclined to make the interwiki to "gismu"; close enough.&mdash;[[User:Sen|sen]] <sup>([[User_talk:Sen|ko tavla]])</sup> 01:19, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

:::why do you say it isn't exactly the same concept? the english word 'give' typically semantically relates arguments in almost exactly the same way that the lojban word, only with a rather awkward syntax. In fact, [[en:arovën|arovën]] words have up to three "object" positions in quite the same way that lojban does. even if the english article is a bit broader or whatever, it seems to be "committed" to exactly the same concept.

:::if jbovlaste is ambiguous about the definition, i think we should opt for the less linguocentric one, since that would be closer in line with the spirit of wikipedia. (by the way, why are we all speaking malglibau?) mi'e [[user:Bobas|bobas]] 18:44, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
