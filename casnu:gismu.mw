[[User:Bobas|Bobas]], why did you change the link to English version of this article? [[en:Gismu]] was a separate article dedicated to Lojban gismu. [[User:Inego|Inego]] 06:36, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

:'gismu' means 'root word', correct? i wasn't aware that it only refered to lojban root words. mi'e [[user:Bobas|bobas]] 21:30, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

::It is kind of an awkward situation. The English Wikipedia article "Gismu" seems to be about Lojban root words. Jbovlaste says, lo gismu "is a (Lojban) root word expressing relation ..." So, it's not totally clear if this article should be specifically about lojbanic gismu. However, the English article on "Root (linguistics)" isn't exactly the same concept, either. I'd be inclined to make the interwiki to "gismu"; close enough.&mdash;[[User:Sen|sen]] <sup>([[User_talk:Sen|ko tavla]])</sup> 01:19, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
